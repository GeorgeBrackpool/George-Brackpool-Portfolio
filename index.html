              <h2>Welcome. Here's some more information about me!</h2>
              <p class="intro">I'm a recent graduate from the University of Brighton where I studied Business Computer Systems and achieved first class honours. Throughout my degree I studied a variety of modules which included databases, object oriented programming, Networks and various business modules such as Digital Marketing and learning about Agile. And of course I also studied Web Development which is where my passion for web development started. For my final year project I created a basic e-learning informative website to learn more about different areas of cybersecurity. You would have to sign up which would give you free access to all the modules to read and learn at your convienience!</p>

                <h3>C#</h3>
                <p>Although I learnt programming using Java during my studies I became familar with C# as my main language of choice after learning the MVC framework which I used for my final project website.I also have some experience with C# after dabbling in Unity in which I used C# to programme a basic 3D cube game where you control the cube and avoid obstacles!</p>

                <h3>SQL Databases and Datamining</h3>
                <p>In each year of study I completed a database module where I learned almost everything there is about SQL and database management. In the final year database module I learnt about Data Mining as well as data models and data warehouse design. I also for coursework had to conduct my own data mining on a bike shop's database that microsoft provide for practice purposes called Adventureworks.</p>
